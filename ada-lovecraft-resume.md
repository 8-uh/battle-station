The term "JavaScript" doesn't really cut it anymore. I keep up with the technical proposals and latest language definitions, and attempt to know which stage a proposal is in. That being said, I generally include `stage-0` in my transpiler plugins when working on a new project as I enjoy having the most advanced abilities available to me.

V8's javascript engine and evented-I/O at the system level
